<h1>Application Process</h1>

<p class="lead">We try to respond to all applications within two days. We realize our decisions impact you and respect that you need an answer quickly.</p>
<h4 class="subtitle">What We're Looking For</h4>

	<p>Top Shelf is interested in bettering ourselves as a guild by making you a part of our team. You should be skilled, vocal, well versed in your class/role and possess a strong desire to conquer challenging content. We’re looking for someone who is going to be in it for the long haul, and someone who puts the needs of Top Shelf and its members over theirs. This means we want unselfish players unafraid to sit out fights sometimes. We are particularly interested in people who are highly motivated and do not need to be told to do something before acting themselves.
	</p>

	<p>If you get offended very easily or don’t respond well to criticism then this is not the guild for you. You are expected to own up to your mistakes, and learn from them. We also expect that your skill will be up to par with any of our other current raiders. We encourage competitiveness and you should drive yourself to become more efficient at adapting to any fight or any role. We’re constantly striving to be the best and so should you.</p>
 <ol class="appProcess">
	<li>Once submitted, your application will be reviewed and discussed by the entire raid team. All of our raiders have a say in the recruiting process because they will be spending the same amount of time with you as the officers.</li>
	<li>We will setup an interview with you to go over our guild discussion, and address any questions or concerns you might have.</li>
	<li>Following your acceptance to the guild, you will be given a trial that lasts at most thirty days, but on average, two to three weeks. You may not trial while you are not wearing our guild tag. No exceptions. During your trial period you may be removed at any time, for any reason. Missing raids during your trial almost always will result in a failed trial and removal from the guild.</li>
	<li>While raiding as a trial in Top Shelf, you may or may not receive loot. Your priority for loot is as follows: Raider > Raiding Alt / Trial / Social Member > D/E</li>
</ol>
