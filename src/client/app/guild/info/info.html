        <h1>Interested in joining Top Shelf?</h1>
        <span></span>
        <p class="lead">Top Shelf is a relatively new, competitive raiding guild on Sargeras-US (CST, Chicago Datacenter). We formed at the
          beginning of Mists of Pandaria on the server Alterac Mountains. Shortly after we began raiding, we decided to move
          to Sargeras in search of stronger competition, active players, and a thriving economy.

                <p>
                  As a guild we are
                  <strong>well-established, focused, progression oriented, and resilient.</strong> We take pride in being
                  <strong>serious without taking ourselves too seriously.</strong> We enjoy long sensual strolls across Azeroth,
                  collecting purples and killing internet dragons. Our guild chat is active and our members do things together
                  outside of just logging in for raids. Many of us hangout in Mumble at all hours of the day.

              <div class="section">
                <p>Many of us in Top Shelf play multiple alts and we encourage all of our raiders to have at-least one well-geared
                  alt that they are able to play on the same level as their main. Our off nights are often filled with alt
                  raids, that are able to full-clear mythic content while it's still relevant (ex: during SoO before the
                  6.0 nerf, we were selling 3 carries per week). Other than raiding, many of us enjoy running challenge mode
                  dungeons and going for realm best times. A handful of our members enjoy PvPing together, but many of us
                  don't partake on a serious level.

            <tab heading="Application Info">
              <h3 class="text-primary">Thinking about applying?</h3>
              <p class="lead">We try to respond to all applications within two days. We realize our decisions impact you and respect that
                you need an answer quickly.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">What We're Looking For</h4>
              <p>Top Shelf is interested in bettering ourselves as a guild by making you a part of our team. You should be skilled,
                vocal, well versed in your class/role and possess a strong desire to conquer challenging content. We’re looking
                for someone who is going to be in it for the long haul, and someone who puts the needs of Top Shelf and its
                members over theirs. This means we want unselfish players unafraid to sit out fights sometimes. We are particularly
                interested in people who are highly motivated and do not need to be told to do something before acting themselves.
              </p>

              <p>If you get offended very easily or don’t respond well to criticism then this is not the guild for you. You
                are expected to own up to your mistakes, and learn from them. We also expect that your skill will be up to
                par with any of our other current raiders. We encourage competitiveness and you should drive yourself to
                become more efficient at adapting to any fight or any role. We’re constantly striving to be the best and
                so should you.</p>
              <ol class="appProcess">
                <li>Once submitted, your application will be reviewed and discussed by the entire raid team. All of our raiders
                  have a say in the recruiting process because they will be spending the same amount of time with you as
                  the officers.</li>
                <li>We will setup an interview with you to go over our guild discussion, and address any questions or concerns
                  you might have.</li>
                <li>Following your acceptance to the guild, you will be given a trial that lasts at most thirty days, but on
                  average, two to three weeks. You may not trial while you are not wearing our guild tag. No exceptions.
                  During your trial period you may be removed at any time, for any reason. Missing raids during your trial
                  almost always will result in a failed trial and removal from the guild.</li>
                <li>While raiding as a trial in Top Shelf, you may or may not receive loot. Your priority for loot is as follows:
                  Raider > Raiding Alt / Trial / Social Member > D/E</li>
              </ol>
            </tab>
            <tab heading="Expectations">
              <h3 class="text-primary">Guild Expectations</h3>

              <p class="lead">We at Top Shelf hold ourselves to
                <strong>high standards; both in raid and outside.</strong> Our members have each others' backs and we expect the
                same from you.</p>

              <ul class="expectations">
                <li>Raiders should possess an in-depth knowledge of their class, its strengths / weaknesses and proper rotations.
                </li>
                <li>Top Shelf provides boss strategies, and links to information from outside sources. We expect each and every
                  raider to know the general strategies and mechanics before raid begins so that our time is spent doing,
                  rather than explaining like you're five.
                </li>
                <li>You are expected to have a name without special characters. If you have them and are accepted, we require
                  that you change your character's name.
                </li>
                <li>We expect you to be able to communicate effectively during encounters. This means having a headset <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i>,
                  working microphone <i class="fa fa-microphone"></i>, and Mumble. If you cannot talk or prefer to never
                  talk, perhaps look elsewhere. We won't force you to speak until it's absolutely necessary, but encourage
                  you to be social!
                </li>
                <li>We want to like you because we all spend a lot of time together. Raiding with players you don't get along
                  with doesnt fit what we're trying to accomplish. This doesn't mean we'll make you hangout and listen to
                  shitty music, or talk sports, but you are encouraged to.
                  <strong>We believe you get out what you put in.</strong> If the guild as a whole is not getting the right "vibe"
                  you will more than likely fail your trial.
                </li>
                <li>You must be tolerant of the stresses involved in competitive raiding, to include repetitive wiping, criticism,
                  being sat during progression, and roster changes.
                </li>
