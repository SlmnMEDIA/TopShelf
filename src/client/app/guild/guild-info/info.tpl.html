                <p class="lead">Top Shelf is a relatively new, competitive raiding guild on Sargeras-US (CST, Chicago Datacenter). We formed at the beginning of Mists of Pandaria on the server Alterac Mountains. Shortly after we began raiding, we decided to move to Sargeras in search of stronger competition, active players, and a thriving economy.</p>
                <p>As a guild we are <strong>well-established, focused, progression oriented, and resilient.</strong> We take pride in being <strong>serious without taking ourselves too seriously.</strong> We enjoy long sensual strolls across Azeroth, collecting purples and killing internet dragons. Our guild chat is active and our members do things together outside of just logging in for raids. Many of us hangout in Mumble at all hours of the day.</p>
                <p>Many of us in Top Shelf play multiple alts and we encourage all of our raiders to have at-least one well-geared alt that they are able to play on the same level as their main. Our off nights are often filled with alt raids, that are able to full-clear mythic content while it's still relevant (ex: during SoO before the 6.0 nerf, we were selling 3 carries per week). Other than raiding, many of us enjoy running challenge mode dungeons and going for realm best times. A handful of our members enjoy PvPing together, but many of us don't partake on a serious level.</p>

                        <p class="lead">We at Top Shelf hold ourselves to <strong>high standards; both in raid and outside.</strong> Our members have each others' backs and we expect the same from you.</p>

                        <ul class="expectations">
                            <li>Raiders should possess an in-depth knowledge of their class, its strengths / weaknesses and proper rotations.</li>
                            <li>Top Shelf provides boss strategies, and links to information from outside sources. We expect each and every raider to know the general strategies and mechanics before raid begins so that our time is spent doing, rather than explaining like you're five.</li>
                            <li>You are expected to have a name without special characters. If you have them and are accepted, we require that you change your character's name.</li>
                            <li>We expect you to be able to communicate effectively during encounters. This means having a headset <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i>, working microphone <i class="fa fa-microphone"></i>, and Mumble. If you cannot talk or prefer to never talk, perhaps look elsewhere. We won't force you to speak until it's absolutely necessary, but encourage you to be social!</li>
                            <li>We want to like you because we all spend a lot of time together. Raiding with players you don't get along with doesnt fit what we're trying to accomplish. This doesn't mean we'll make you hangout and listen to shitty music, or talk sports, but you are encouraged to. <strong>We believe you get out what you put in.</strong> If the guild as a whole is not getting the right "vibe" you will more than likely fail your trial.</li>
                            <li>You must be tolerant of the stresses involved in competitive raiding, to include repetitive wiping, criticism, being sat during progression, and roster changes.</li>
                        </ul>
