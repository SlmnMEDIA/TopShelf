                <h2><strong>Our</strong> Expectations</h2>
                <p class="lead">We at Top Shelf hold ourselves to high standards, both in raid and outside. Our members have each others backs and we expect the same from you.</p>

                  <ul class="expectations">
                    <li>Raiders should possess an in depth knowledge of their class, its strengths / weaknesses and proper rotations. This includes knowledge of your offspec.</li>
                    <li>Top Shelf provides boss strategies, and links to resources from outside sources. We expect each and every raider
                        to know the strategies and mechanics before raid begins.</li>
                    <li>You are expected to have a name without special characters. If you have them and are accepted, we require that you change your character's name.</li>
                    <li>We expect you to be able to communicate effectively during encounters. This means having a headset, working microphone and Mumble. If you cannot talk or prefer to never talk, perhaps look elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>We want to like you because we all spend a lot of time together and playing with players you don't like is never
                    a recipe for success. This doesn't mean we'll make you hangout and listen to shitty music, or talk sports, but you are encouraged to. We believe you get out what you put in. If the guild as a whole is not getting the right "vibe" you will more than likely fail your trial.</li>
                    <li>You must be tolerant of the stresses involved in competitive raiding, to include repetitive wiping, criticism, being sat during progression, and roster changes.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h2><strong>Application</strong> Process</h2>
                <p class="lead">We try to respond to all applications within two days. We realize our decisions impact you and respect that you need an answer quickly.</p>
               <ul class="appProcess">
               <li>Once submitted, your application will be reviewed and discussed by the entire raid team. All of our raiders have a say in the recruiting process because they will be spending the same amount of time with you as the officers.</li>
               <li>We will setup an interview with you to go over our guild discussion, and address any questions or concerns you might have.</li>
               <li>Following your acceptance to the guild, you will be given a trial that lasts at most thirty days, but on average, two to three weeks. You may not trial while you are not wearing our guild tag. No exceptions. During your trial period you may be removed at any time, for any reason. Missing raids during your trial almost always will result in a failed trial and removal from the guild.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>Please <strong>do not</strong> apply if:</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>You're not 18.</li>
                  <li>You cannot commit to 90% of our raids</li>
                  <li>You do not possess or use a microphone</li>
                  <li>You are a package deal</li>
