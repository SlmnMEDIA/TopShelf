### Gulp, Sass and other fixes
- I realized for whatever reason the Sass files were not being processed by gulp properly for
 whatever reason. After a few hours debugging, it turned into redoing the build process.
- Changed the overall look and feel of the site to match the forums better.
- Lots to continue doing in order to finish up the look.
- Next order of business is a toss up between Battlenet Integration, fixing the roster or tapping into
    Xenforo's API

- Removed the roster state and unused or redundant files. Roster is not ready for release.
