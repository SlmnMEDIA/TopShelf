## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## 2015-03-10
### Version 0.5.0
- Getting closer to full 1.0 beta version. This update fixes the full sized image embeds when
viewing uploaded media. All twitch streams are implemented.

## 2015-02-09
### Alpha 1
- Things are starting to take shape and at this time I'd like to think that we're ready for  
the first alpha version. Everything implemented is working fairly well. The only way to find bugs
is to get this out there and used.

## 2015-01-18
### Gulp, Sass and other fixes
- I realized for whatever reason the Sass files were not being processed by gulp properly for
 whatever reason. After a few hours debugging, it turned into redoing the build process.
- Changed the overall look and feel of the site to match the forums better.
- Lots to continue doing in order to finish up the look.
- Next order of business is a toss up between Battlenet Integration, fixing the roster or tapping into
    Xenforo's API

## 2015-01-16
### Added
- Decided to stop being lazy and finally start keeping a changelog.
- Removed the roster state and unused or redundant files. Roster is not ready for release.
- Switched the admin side navigation to horizonal modeled after the main site.
- Updated all dependencies.
