        <h1>About Top Shelf</h1>

        <p>Top Shelf was formed in 2012 on Alterac Mountains. After a few months of raiding and trying to make the best of our situation on a dying server, the guild moved to Sargeras. We’ve been climbing the ranks on Sargeras and in the United States. </p>

        <p>We have had our share of roster changes but have always been consistently strong. I’m proud to say we have been raiding continuously, week after week since coming together. What may topple many other guilds has made this raid team even stronger. Warlords of Draenor is adding another challenge for Top Shelf to face. We are evolving again, this time into a 20 man Mythic guild. To prepare for that we expanded to 25 man Heroic during our 10 man progression and secured our spot as a top 200 US 25 man raiding guild.</p>

                    <p>A good portion of the Top Shelf raiding core comes from a “hardcore” background. Some of our raiders and leadership were previously in US top-100 guilds, while others have been guild/raid/class leaders. All that aside, Top Shelf is comprised of a talented group of raiders. We all have that itch for progression, so we take our raid time seriously. We need to clear all content while it’s current while still having a fucking blast with one another. You won’t find a guild with an environment quite like Top Shelf. We’re laid back, mature in all the right ways, immature when it counts, and most importantly we get shit done.</p>

                    </accordion-heading>
                    <p>Expectations:
                        We expect you to know your class, know the fights before we pull, and to speak on Mumble. You must be able to commit to our raid schedule and admit when you fuck up, fix it, and move on. It’s also recommended that you don’t get offended easily, and our capable of both receiving and delivering quality shit talking, when necessary. We do recruit for a small “bench” so that we are able to class stack and always have the numbers to raid. This does not mean we tolerate absences without notice, but we are lenient when you keep us in the loop. Trials are expected to have 100% attendance. During your trial period if you miss a raid without saying anything you will fail your trial and be removed.

                        We log all fights and a handful of our raiders stream to Twitch. Raiders are encouraged to use these resources to evaluate their own performances. </p>

                    </accordion-heading>
                    <p>Loot system:
                        We use a loot council system comprised of officers and members of the raid team. Attendance, quality of play and best interest of the guild all play important factors in who receives loot.</p>

                    <p>Benefits
                        We provide our raiders with all consumables and repairs. In our guild bank, raiders have access to gems and enchants. Trials are treated as full raiders in regards to guild provided benefits, but are lower priority for loot. </p>

        <p>We are looking for driven, competent, reliable and active raiders to join our family. We don't hold much back in guild chat or on mumble so a sense of humor and thick skin is recommended. If you are offended by criticism easily, best of luck, but you might want to keep on looking. If this sounds like you, than we would love the opportunity to get to know you.</p>

        Anyone interested in joining as a social or for flex modes is more than welcome!
